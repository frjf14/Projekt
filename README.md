Setup
-----

Clone or download the repo. To set it up you will need a mysql database. Change the settings in the config folder <code>app/config/database_mysql.php</code> file. To make the css styling work correctly the file <code>webroot/css/anax-grid/style.less.cache</code> must have write premission. When the site is up and running type <code>setup.php</code> in the adress to get to the page and click the button which will create the tables in the database. This could also be used to reset the database/remove all of its content.
